- Cleaned and prepared Brent oil price data  
- Initial EDA (trends, volatility, stationarity)  
- Structured event dataset  
- Interim report with findings and next steps  

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels

## Next Steps
- **Task 2:** Bayesian change point modeling  
- **Task 3:** Interactive dashboard (Flask + React)
